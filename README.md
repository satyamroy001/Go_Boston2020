I AM USING 2 DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR THIS-----
1. INTERMEDIATE IOT 
    1. ARDUINO
    2.IMU
    3.SERVO MORTOR (2)
    4. MORTOR DRIVER
    5.JUMPER
    
2. Design of a Two-Wheel Self-Balancing Robot with the Implementation of a Novel State Feedback for PID Controller using On-Board State Estimation Algorithm.
1. theoretical approach only.
